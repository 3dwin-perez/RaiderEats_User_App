# Project Overview



This project is a mobile application built with Flutter framework, Dart programming language, and Firebase as the database. The application, Raider One, integrates two primary applications: Raider Eats and Raider Ride.

Raider Eats is a food delivery app that allows users who are students to actively order online food that sellers on the Texas Tech University campus have provided on their menu, making it easier for students to order and receive food from their desired restaurants during school hours. This eliminates the need for students to wait in long lines and allows them to enjoy their meals without leaving campus. The orders are delivered by riders who offer their delivery services to sellers, ensuring that the food is safely and promptly delivered to and from campus.

To fulfill its total functionality, Raider Eats is composed of three subtotal applications: the Sellers App, the Delivery App, and the Customers App. The Sellers App is exclusively for restaurant owners who want to sell their food through the application. The Delivery App is designed for riders who want to offer their delivery services to sellers. The Customers App is for users who want to order food from their favorite restaurants.
